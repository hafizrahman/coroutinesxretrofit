# coroutines x retrofit
This is a quick test project to implement Retrofit using Kotlin's coroutines.

The project is a normal MVVM Android app. The app pulls a list of categories available from freebbble.com, using WordPress's REST API. Specifically, it's calling for http://freebbble.com/wp-json/wp/v2/categories/

Being called using Retrofit, that URL path returns a JSON array of categories. For simplicity sake, the app then picks the first Category and displays its `link` property on the app.

Here's what the app might show when being run properly:
